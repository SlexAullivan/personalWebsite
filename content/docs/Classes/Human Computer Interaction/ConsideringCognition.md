title: Considering Cognition

## **What is cognition?**

Cognition is many things but essentially how we think. Our cognition can be mader up of many parts. For example:

* attention
* perception
* memory
* learning
* reading, speaking and listening
* problem soving, planning, reasoning and decison making

Rarely are these used in a vacuum one at a time, instead human cognition involves many of these often at the same time. The most relevant for this course are probably attention and memory.

### **Attention**

Attention refers to our ability to concentrate on something at a given point in time. This is made easier or harder by two things, whether what we want to focus on is clearly defined and whether or no the information we are looking for is easily discerned from the environment. This can be greatly affected by the way in which information is presented to us.

Today so many people spend a great amount of time switching between tasks and screens. This has been shown to affect our retention, depending on how much attention each task requires. Switching between multiple difficult tasks negatively affects ou retention.

### **Perception**

How information is taken from the environment and translated  into an experience. Perception is incredibly complex and can take into account other cognitive processes like memory.

### **Memory**

Memory is how we recall information and how that information affects our responses allowing us to act appropriately for the situation. Memories are filtered so that we dont have the burden of remembering every detail from our lives. Often our memories are situational where its much eeasier to remember something within a given context. I remember once seeing a barist of a cafe I went to often at a restaraunt, and I didnt recognize him at the time, because I was used to seeing him within a different context.

### **Learning**

Most people prefer to learn through doing, rather than reading a manual.  There have been many attempts at harnessing new types of media to teach concepts in ways that cant be accomplished in a traditional sense like a textbook. Thus we should desing interfaces that encourage exploration.

### **Reading Speaking and Listening**

These are forms of language processing, and generally the meaning of any information reperesented in any of these forms stays the same. A phrase has the same general meaning whther you hear it, read it, or say it. the design implications are that we should keep voice menus with few choices because people can not remember more than a few options, and we should accentuate the intonation of artificially generated speech voices because they can be harder to understand than a humans.

### **Problem solving, planning and decision making**

These are processes involved with reflective cognition. including thinking about what to do, what the options are, and what the consequences are. Different from many of the previous cognitive processes is the fac that these are often conscious processes.

## **Cognitive Frameworks**

### **Mental Models**

From experiences people will often develop mental models of how something works often derived by how they know something else works. For example, most people know that by turning the handle of the faucet further increases the flow of water. So someone may take that mental model and apply it to their thermostat, thinking that if they turn the temperature on higher then the house will warm up quicker but this is a false mental model.

Often times people have incomplete or poor mental models of how something works. Because of this interactive tachnologies should be designed to be "transparent" where there is useful feedback to user input and easily understood intuitive ways of interaction.
  
### **Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation**

This refers to the gaps between  the user and the interface.

* gulf of execution: distance from user to the physical system
* gulf of evaluation: distance from the physical system to the user

### **Information Processing**

This refers tot he idea of making an anlogy between the mind and an information processor. wher einformation is thought to enter and exit the mind through a series of ordered processing stages.

### **Distributed Cognition**

Because most cognitive activities  involve wit interactions with other people, documents, books or computers we can view cognition as distributed. A primary objective of the distrubuted approach is to study people the artifacts they use and the environment in which they work. and how information is represented and re represented as it moves across individuals and through different mediums.

an example of a cognitive system is an airline pilot where the top level goal is to fly the plane. This involves many facets like the pilot,and air traffic controller interacting with one another, or the pilot interacting with the instruments within the plane.

This model is unique because it focuses on what is happening across a system of individuals and artifacts.

### **External Cognition**

External cognition is concerned with explaining the cognitive processes involved when we interact with different external representations. An external representation could  be something like a book or a webpage, or a drawing/ diagram.

Benefits of using different representations for different cognitive activities:

1. externalizing to reduce memory load (using a todo app)
2. computational offloading (solving a math problem with pen and paper)
3. annotating and cognitive tracing (crossing something off of a todo list)
